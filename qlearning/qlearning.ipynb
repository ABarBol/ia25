    "## What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is like teaching through trial and error - an agent learns by trying actions, receiving feedback (rewards), and gradually improving its behavior. Think of training a pet with treats, learning to ride a bike through practice, or mastering a video game by playing it repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, RL is about teaching an **Agent** (our algorithm) how to behave in an **Environment** (our game or problem) to maximize a **Reward**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's based on a simple loop:\n",
    "1.  The **Agent** observes the **State** (S) of the environment.\n",
    "2.  The **Agent** chooses an **Action** (A).\n",
    "3.  The **Environment** reacts: it gives the agent a **Reward** (R) and a new **State** (S').\n",
    "4.  The Agent learns from this (S, A, R, S') tuple and the loop repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create an agent that, from any state, learns to pick the action that will give it the most *cumulative future reward*.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Understanding Q-Learning Intuitively\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning builds a giant “cheat sheet” called a Q-table that tells the agent how good each action is in each situation:\n",
    "- Rows = different situations (states) the agent can encounter\n",
    "- Columns = different actions the agent can take\n",
    "- Values = how good that action is in that situation (expected future reward)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try an action and see what happens (reward + new state)\n",
    "2. Update your cheat sheet: “That action was better/worse than I thought”\n",
    "3. Gradually improve by trying actions and updating estimates\n",
    "4. Balance exploration vs exploitation: Try new things vs use what you know works\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it works: Over time, good actions get higher Q-values, bad actions get lower Q-values. The agent learns to pick actions with the highest expected rewards.\n",
